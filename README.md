## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone [repository-url]
cd job-apply-automation
```

2. **Install backend dependencies**

```
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**

```
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. **Install Python dependencies**

```
cd ../ml-models/resume_matcher
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

5. **Configure MongoDB**

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/job-automation
PORT=5001
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

6. **Start the application**

Using the provided scripts (Windows):

```
scripts/start_server.bat
```

Or manually:

```
# Start backend (from backend directory)
npm start

# Start frontend (from frontend directory)
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Could not load spaCy model" error

This occurs when the en_core_web_sm model is not installed:

```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### 2. Report download not working

Check the following:

- Server is running on port 5001
- Backend reports directory exists
- Report files are being generated correctly

Use the test script to diagnose issues:

```
node scripts/test_server.js
```

#### 3. MongoDB connection issues

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or your connection string is correct in your .env file.

#### 4. PDF generation errors

PDF generation depends on proper text extraction from documents. Check that:

- Resume files are properly formatted
- You have permissions to create files in the reports directory
- The file paths are correctly configured
